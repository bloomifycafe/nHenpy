<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Why?

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://totenk0pf.tk)

Because I can.


### Built With

* [Python](https://python.org)
* [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)
* [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Do you want your very own copy of nHenpy running on your computer? Does being _**horny**_ on main make you feel like you're on a power trip? Then just follow these simple steps to tell everyone in your Discord servers that you're ready to smash anything that stands in your way!

### Prerequisites

There are actually only two packages you need to install this monstrosity:
* discord.py
```sh
pip install -U discord.py
```
* beautifulsoup4
```sh
pip install -U beautifulsoup4
```

### Installation
 
1. Clone nHenpy
```sh
git clone https://github.com/totenk0pf/nHenpy.git
```
2. Create a new Discord application for your bot, copy the newly-generated token and replace the empty TOKEN string with it.



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Locate to wherever your nhen.py file is, and use the following command to start the bot.
```sh
python nhen.py
```
Display all available commands by entering:
```
.help
```
Display information about a specific code, or a random code if you're feeling lucky:
```
.sex <code|random>
```
Return a random hentai from a specific list of tags:
```
.tags <tags>
```

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_
